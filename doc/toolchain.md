Introduction
------------
I had hoped that I would be able to just sit down and crank out some shell
scripts to automate a lot of this, but in the end, it made more sense to just
document what I've been doing, what the outcome of each step in the sequence has
been, and how to actually do everything from scratch instead.

Binutils
--------
The binutils package contains, among other things, the assembler and linker
needed to build and generate binaries for the target platform.

```bash
$ foo

```
